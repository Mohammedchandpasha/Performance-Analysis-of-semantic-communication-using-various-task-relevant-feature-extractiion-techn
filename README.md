# Performance-Analysis-of-semantic-communication-using-various-task-relevant-feature-extractiion-techniques 
This project analyzes the performance of semantic communication systems by employing different task-relevant feature extraction techniques, such as:

1)Autoencoder-based feature extraction
2)Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
3) Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
## Project Objectives
- Evaluate how different feature extraction methods impact classification accuracy in a semantic communication.
- Simulate a communication system with a noisy channel and assess robustness.
- Compare classification performance across various SNR levels.
